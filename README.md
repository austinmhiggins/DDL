# Downtown Dallas Life

Downtown Dallas Life is a single-page JavaScript app I created to showcase what all my neighborhood (Downtown Dallas) has to offer. 

While eating downtown one night, I wondered how many activities and activity combinations could I enjoy in Dallas without repeating any? 

So I made this simple tribute to my neighborhood with a series of arrays, buttons and a random number generator.

A user is given the option to plan a day or plan a night downtown. Users are then given a set of activities to do with links.
