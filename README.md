# Downtown Dallas Life

Downtown Dallas Life is a single-page JavaScript app I created to showcase what all my neighborhood (Downtown Dallas) has to offer. 

While eating downtown one night, I wondered how many activities and activity combinations could I enjoy in Dallas without repeating any? 

I used inline JS and CSS (gross, right?) with a random number generator.
